CS340 Zoo Work Order System Project

The website allows work orders to be created by zookeepers to perform and record the work orders that were performed. The database will store information about each work order such as which Zoo_Keepers are assigned to it, which enclosure the work order will service, which task is required to be performed in the work order, the supplies needed, and whether the work order is accepted, overdue or completed. The database will also store information pertaining to each zookeeper, animal enclosure, task, and supply. 
The animal enclosures will house monkeys, tigers, penguins, giraffes, and turtles. The tasks that may appear on the work order range from cleaning the enclosure, feeding the animals, conducting zoo tours for visitors to the zoo, veterinary appointments, and providing an enriching environment for the animals to live in.
